<p>Reach uses <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>, which means that given Reach version number <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code>,</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>MAJOR</code> versions are incompatible.</li>
  <li><code>MINOR</code> versions are compatible, but have additional features relative to earlier versions.</li>
  <li><code>PATCH</code> versions are entirely compatible.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the major version <code>0.y.z</code> is pre-stability and makes no promises about compatibility of any kind.</p>
<hr>
<p>Reach source code starts with</p>
<pre class="snippet numbered"><ol class="snippet"><li value="1"><span style="color: #032F62">'reach reach-short-vers'</span><span style="color: #24292E">;</span></li></ol></pre>
<p>because this indicates that it relies on this major version and the features added in this minor version.</p>
<hr>
<p>Reach tools are specified by the entire version number with a <code>v</code> at the front, <code>vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code>, but are also available at all prefixes (i.e., <code>vMAJOR.MINOR</code> and <code>vMAJOR</code>). Additionally, there is a version <code>stable</code> which resolves to the most recent stable <code>vMAJOR</code> version.</p>
