<p>Reach uses semantic versioning, which means that given Reach version number <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code>,</p>
<p><code>MAJOR</code> versions are incompatible.</p>
<p><code>MINOR</code> versions are compatible, but have additional features relative to earlier versions.</p>
<p><code>PATCH</code> versions are entirely compatible.</p>
<p>However, the major version 0.y.z is pre-stability and makes no promises about compatibility of any kind.</p>
<p>Reach source code starts with 'reach 0.1' because this indicates that it relies on this major version and the features added in this minor version.</p>
<p>Reach tools are specified by the entire version number with a v at the front, vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, but are also available at all prefixes (i.e., vMAJOR.MINOR and vMAJOR). Additionally, there is a version stable which resolves to the most recent stable vMAJOR version.</p>
