<p>Most Reach examples, tutorials, and workshops use JavaScript as the language of choice for frontend implementation, but Reach supports frontend development in any language via the Reach RPC Server. This server allows backends compiled to JavaScript to be provided to another language via a simple RPC protocol.</p>
<p>Currently, Reach provides RPC client implementations for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Go</li>
</ul>
<p>The tutorial section on RPC-based frontends provides a walkthrough of using these libraries.</p>
<p>If your language of choice isn't available yet, it is very simple to implement one yourself if you've ever used a JSON-based RPC protocol before. Most implementations are less than 100 lines of code! Or, you could submit a request for Reach to build one on the Reach GitHub issue tracker or on the Discord community.</p>
