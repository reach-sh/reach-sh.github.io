<p>
  In this workshop, we'll design an application that allows a Funder
  to create an auction where participants may purchase tickets.
  The Funder sets a ticket price and a relative deadline. When
  a Buyer purchases a ticket, the deadline is reset. Whoever is the
  last person to buy a ticket—when the deadline finally hits—wins
  the entire balance. This program is based off of the crypto game,
  <a href="https://fomo3d.hostedwiki.co/">FOMO3DGame</a>.
</p>
<p>This workshop utilizes participant classes to represent Buyers, which allows us to handle multiple participants in a generic way.</p>

<h2 id="problem-analysis">Problem Analysis</h2>
<p>
  First, we should think over the details of the application and
  answer some questions to help reason about the implementation of
  the program.
</p>
<p>
  You should write the answer to the following questions in your
  Reach program (<code>index.rsh</code>) using a comment.
  <code>/* Remember comments are written like this. */</code>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who is involved in this application?</li>
  <li>What information do they know at the start of the program?</li>
  <li>
    What information are they going to discover and use
    in the program?
  </li>
  <li>What funds change ownership during the application and how?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Write down the problem analysis of this program as a comment.</strong></p>
<p>Let's see how your answers compare to ours:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    This program involves two parties: a Funder who deploys the
    auction and the Buyers who purchase tickets.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Funder knows the deadline and the ticket price at the
    start of the application.
  </li>
  <li>The Buyers do not know anything of the deadline or ticket price when the application begins.</li>
  <li>The Funder does not learn anything during the program execution.</li>
  <li>
    The Buyers learn of the ticket price and deadline during the
    program execution.
  </li>
  <li>Buyers continually add funds to the balance during execution until one Buyer wins the entire balance.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's okay if some of your answers differ from ours!</p>
<h2 id="data-definition">Data Definition</h2>
<p>
  After problem analysis, we need to decide how we will represent the information
  in the program:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>What data type will represent the deadline set by the Funder?</li>
  <li>What data type will represent the ticket price set by the Funder?</li>
  <li>What data type will represent the Buyer's decision to purchase a ticket?</li>
</ul>
<p>
  ::: note
  Refer to ${seclink("ref-programs-types")}for a reminder of what data types are available in Reach.
  :::
</p>
<p>Now that we've decided what data types to use, we need to determine how the programs will obtain this information. We need to outline the participant interact interface for each participant.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What participant interact interface will Funder use?</li>
  <li>What participant interact interface will Buyer use?</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Revisit the problem analysis section when completing this section. Whenever
  a participant starts off with some knowledge, that will be a field in the
  <code>interact</code> object.
  If they learn something, then it will be an argument to a function.
  If they provide something later, then it will be the result of a function.
</p>
<p>You should write your answers in your Reach file (<code>index.rsh</code>) as the participant interact interface for each of the participants.</p>
<p><strong>Write down the data definitions for this program as definitions.</strong></p>
<p>Let's compare your answers with ours:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The deadline will be represented with a <code>UInt</code>, as it is
    a relative time delta signifying a change in block numbers.
  </li>
  <li>The <code>ticketPrice</code> will be represented with a <code>UInt</code></li>
  <li>The decision to buy a ticket will be represented by a function <code>Fun([UInt], Bool)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Our participant interact interface, with the addition of some handy logging functions, looks like this so far:</p>
<p>${code("/examples/workshop-fomo/index.rsh", 4, 22)}</p>
<p>
  At this point, you can modify your JavaScript file (<code>index.mjs</code>) to contain definitions of these values, although you may want to use placeholders for the actual values.
  When you're writing a Reach program, especially in the early phases, you should have these two files open side-by-side and update them in tandem as you're deciding the participant interact interface.
</p>
<h2 id="communication-construction">Communication Construction</h2>
<p>
  A fundamental aspect of a decentralized application is the pattern of communication
  and transfer among the participants. We should write down this structure as comments
  in our program to serve as an outline and guide us in implementation.
  For example, for the <a href="##tut">tutorial</a> version of <em>Rock, Paper, Scissors!</em>, we might write:
</p>
<pre class="snippet numbered"><ol class="snippet"><li value="1"><span style="color: #6A737D">// Alice publishes the wager and pays it</span></li><li value="2"><span style="color: #6A737D">// Bob accepts the wager and pays it</span></li><li value="3"><span style="color: #6A737D">// While there's a draw</span></li><li value="4"><span style="color: #6A737D">//  Alice publishes her hand secretly</span></li><li value="5"><span style="color: #6A737D">//  Bob publishes his hand publicly</span></li><li value="6"><span style="color: #6A737D">//  Alice reveals her hand</span></li><li value="7"><span style="color: #6A737D">//  The consensus ensures it's the same hand as before</span></li><li value="8"><span style="color: #6A737D">// The consensus pays out the wager</span></li></ol></pre>
<p>You should do this now, in your Reach program (<code>index.rsh</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Write down the communication pattern for this program as comments.</strong></p>
<p>Here's what we wrote for our outline:</p>
<pre class="snippet numbered"><ol class="snippet"><li value="1"><span style="color: #6A737D">// 1. The Funder publishes the ticket price and deadline</span></li><li value="2"><span style="color: #6A737D">// 2. While the deadline has yet to be reached:</span></li><li value="3"><span style="color: #6A737D">//     2a. Allow a Buyer to purchase a ticket</span></li><li value="4"><span style="color: #6A737D">//     2b. Keep track of last Buyer</span></li><li value="5"><span style="color: #6A737D">// 3. Transfer the balance to the last person who bought a ticket</span></li></ol></pre>
<p>Now, this outline needs to be converted to a real program.</p>
<p><strong>Write down the communication pattern for this program as code.</strong></p>
<p>The body of your application should look something like this:</p>
<pre class="snippet numbered"><ol class="snippet"><li value="1"><span style="color: #6A737D">// 1.

<p>
  We use <code>parallelReduce</code> to allow Buyers to purchase tickets until
  the deadline passes and accumulate the current winner. We maintain the invariant
  that the balance must be equal to the number of tickets sold multiplied by the
  ticket price.
</p>
<h2 id="assertion-insertion">Assertion Insertion</h2>
<p>
  This program doesn't have many interesting properties to prove
  as assertions, beyond the token linearity property. The
  only property of interest is the <code>parallelReduce</code> invariant
  which states that the balance must be equal to the number of tickets
  sold multiplied by the ticket price.
</p>
<h2 id="interaction-introduction">Interaction Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Next, we need to insert the appropriate calls to <code>interact</code>.
  In this case, our program is very simple and we expect you'll do a great job without further discussion.
</p>
<p><strong>Insert <code>interact</code> calls to the frontend into the program.</strong></p>
<p>Let's look at our whole program now:</p>
<p>${code("/examples/workshop-fomo/index.rsh")}</p>
<h2 id="deployment-decisions">Deployment Decisions</h2>
<p>
  Next, it is time to test our program. As usual, we'll present a completely
  automated test deployment, rather than an interactive one.
</p>
<p>
  The program is fairly straightfoward to test. We just create test accounts for
  the Funder and any number of Buyers. The decision to purchase a ticket by
  a Buyer will rely simply on generating a random boolean.
</p>
<p><strong>Decide how you will deploy and use this application.</strong></p>
<p>Here's the JavaScript frontend we wrote:</p>
<p>${code("/examples/workshop-fomo/index.mjs")}</p>
<p>Let's see what it looks like when we run the program:</p>
<pre class="snippet numbered"><ol class="snippet"><li value="1">$ ../reach run</li><li value="2">Buyer 0 bought a ticket.</li><li value="3">Buyer 3 bought a ticket.</li><li value="4">...</li><li value="5">Buyer 5 bought a ticket.</li><li value="6">Buyer 9 bought a ticket.</li><li value="7">Buyer 1 bought a ticket.</li><li value="8">Funder saw 0x94CAC1b24C1f7b0EBAD4A51797dE5d59A39910C4 won.</li><li value="9">Buyer 5 saw they lost.</li><li value="10">Buyer 1 saw they won.</li><li value="11">Buyer 6 saw they lost.</li><li value="12">Buyer 0 saw they lost.</li><li value="13">Buyer 4 saw they lost.</li><li value="14">Buyer 8 saw they lost.</li><li value="15">Buyer 2 saw they lost.</li><li value="16">Buyer 7 saw they lost.</li><li value="17">Buyer 3 saw they lost.</li><li value="18">Buyer 9 saw they lost.</li></ol></pre>
