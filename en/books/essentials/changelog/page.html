</p>
<h2 id="016-202110---present">0.1.6: 2021/10 - present</h2>
<p>Version 0.1.6 is the current Reach release candidate version.</p>
<ul>
  <li>2021/11/02: Allow <code>API</code>s and <code>View</code>s to be specified without names.</li>
  <li>2021/10/28: <code>REACH_CONNECTOR_MODE</code> no longer defaults to <code>ETH</code> when unset.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users are instead encouraged to run <a href="##ref-usage-config">(exec reach config)</a> to set a persistent default in their shell or supply <code>REACH_CONNECTOR_MODE</code> explicitly at the command-line and in scripts.</p>
<p>Attempting to <code>reach run|react|rpc-server|rpc-run|devnet</code> without setting <code>REACH_CONNECTOR_MODE</code> in one's terminal will result in an error message being shown and execution aborted.</p>
<ul>
  <li>2021/10/28: Added XXX (seclink "ref-usage-config" (exec "reach config") " subcommand").</li>
  <li>2021/10/28: The backend interface to deployed contracts was updated, so old contracts will not work with this version.</li>
  <li>2021/10/28: The backend interface to the compiled objects was updated, so you'll need to recompile for this release.</li>
  <li>2021/10/20: Added <code>decimals</code> field for token minting.</li>
  <li>2021/10/18: Added APIs via the <code>API</code> form.</li>
  <li>2021/10/15: The backend interface to deployed contracts was updated, so old contracts will not work with this version.</li>
  <li>2021/10/15: The backend interface to the compiled objects was updated, so you'll need to recompile for this release.</li>
  <li>2021/10/15: Algorand devnet updated to versions 3.0.1 and 2.6.4</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="015-202109---202110">0.1.5: 2021/09 - 2021/10</h2>
<p>Version 0.1.5 is the current Reach release version.</p>
<ul>
  <li>2021/10/15: Added <code>setValidQueryWindow</code>.</li>
  <li>2021/10/11: The Solidity compiler has been upgraded to 0.8.9.</li>
  <li>2021/10/08: The backend interface to the compiled objects was updated, so you'll need to recompile for this release.</li>
  <li>2021/10/08: <code>parallelReduce</code> is more strict in checking that the <code>msg</code> argument is present in the parameter list of <code>case</code> components, even when it is is bound to a <code>null</code>.</li>
  <li>2021/10/08: Added <code>getContract</code> and <code>getAddress</code>.</li>
  <li>2021/10/08: Added <code>ctc.getContractAddress</code>.</li>
  <li>2021/10/05: Added <code>Contract</code>. Updated <code>ctc.getInfo</code> to return a <code>Contract</code>.</li>
  <li>2021/10/04: Added <code>unstrict</code>.</li>
  <li>
    2021/09/25: Reach clients will detect that they are attempting to publish in a race that they cannot win and switch to listening for the publication of another.
    This has the impact of frontends not being asked to sign transactions that cannot possibly succeed.
  </li>
  <li>2021/09/25: Added <code>didPublish()</code>.</li>
  <li>2021/09/24: Contracts do not store the Merkleization of the state, but store the state itself; this changes the interface to contracts, so this release cannot communicate with DApps compiled by older versions of Reach.</li>
  <li>2021/09/16: Bare integers used as time arguments will throw a deprecation warning. Use <code>relativeTime</code> instead.</li>
  <li>2021/09/16: The concept of deployment modes has been removed and the only available behavior is what was previously the <code>firstMsg</code> deployment mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you would like the old behavior, then you'll want to create a new participant, perhaps called <code>Constructor</code>, that exists simply to run <code>Constructor.publish(); commit();</code>, but we expect that almost no one actually wants the old behavior exactly.
  Instead, you probably want to select one of your existing participants and assign the first publication to them.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>2021/09/16: The backend interface to deployed contracts was updated, so old contracts will not work with this version.</li>
  <li>2021/09/16: The backend interface to the compiled objects was updated, so you'll need to recompile for this release.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="014-202109---202109">0.1.4: 2021/09 - 2021/09</h2>
<p>Version 0.1.4 is is an old Reach release version.</p>
<ul>
  <li>2021/09/15: <code>muldiv</code> added.</li>
  <li>2021/09/08: Add <code>--stop-after-eval</code> and <code>--verify-timeout</code> options to <code>reach compile</code>.</li>
  <li>2021/08/31: Removed <code>getSignStrategy</code> and <code>setSignStrategy</code> in favor of <code>setWalletFallBack</code> and <code>walletFallback</code>.</li>
  <li>2021/08/31: Algorand devnet updated to versions 2.9.1 and 2.6.1</li>
  <li>2021/08/31: The <code>reach</code> command-line has changed:</li>
  <li>All subcommands now support <code>-h</code>/<code>--help</code> switches, e.g. <code>reach compile --help</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>APP</code> argument to ${seclink("ref-usage-init")} has been removed.</li>
  <li>The <code>reach</code> script now permits the use of subdirectories as arguments to certain subcommands, e.g. <code>reach compile dir/index.rsh</code>, but disallows parent directories (<code>..</code>) for reasons pertaining to Docker.</li>
  <li>Devnets have been consolidated into a single Dockerized network and container topology.</li>
  <li>The <code>--use-existing-devnet</code> flag has been deprecated and no longer has any effect.</li>
  <li>
    ${seclink("ref-usage-run")} will now automatically connect to a given connector's devnet when already present.
    Devnets which are not yet running will be launched as needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    ${seclink("ref-usage-down")} now halts <em>ALL</em> Dockerized Reach containers and devnets (i.e. it's no longer specific to a single project).
    Non-Reach Docker services are unaffected (see ${seclink("ref-usage-docker-reset")}).
  </li>
  <li>
    ${seclink("ref-usage-docker-reset")} now prompts the user for confirmation before continuing since it kills and removes <em>ALL</em> containers (not just those related to Reach).
    The <code>-y</code> or <code>--even-non-reach</code> flags may be appended for non-interactive execution.
  </li>
  <li>An <code>--await-background</code> flag has been introduced to the ${seclink("ref-usage-devnet")} subcommand.</li>
  <li>
    The <code>reach</code> script has been simplified such that <code>Makefile</code> and <code>docker-compose.yml</code> files are no longer integral to its function.
    Accordingly, these files have been removed from ${seclink("ref-usage-scaffold")}'s output.
    Authors of existing projects which contain unmodified <code>Makefile</code> or <code>docker-compose.yml</code> files are encouraged to remove them.
  </li>
</ul>
