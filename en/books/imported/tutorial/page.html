  This tutorial walks through the creation of a simple decentralized application.
  It contains everything you need to know to build and test this application and assumes no prior experience with DApp/blockchain development of any kind.
  If you want a broad overview before diving in it, we recommend reading <a href="##overview">the overview</a> first.
  On the other hand, if this is too simple, then you may want to start <a href="##workshop">the workshop</a> for larger and less contrained projects or <a href="##ref">the reference manual</a> for the minute details of Reach.

  Reach is designed to work on POSIX systems with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">make</a>, <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started">Docker</a>, and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">Docker Compose</a> installed.
  The best way to install Docker on Mac and Windows is with <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop">Docker Desktop</a>.
</p>
<p>
  ::: note
  You probably already have <code>make</code> installed.
  For example, OS X and many other POSIX systems come with <code>make</code>, but some versions of Linux do not include it by default and will require you to install it.
  If you're on Ubuntu, you can run <code>sudo apt install make</code> to get it.
  :::
</p>
<p>You'll know that you have everything installed if you can run the following three commands without errors</p>
<pre class="snippet numbered"><ol class="snippet"><li value="1">$ make --version</li></ol></pre>
<pre class="snippet numbered"><ol class="snippet"><li value="1">$ docker --version</li></ol></pre>
<pre class="snippet numbered"><ol class="snippet"><li value="1">$ docker-compose --version</li></ol></pre>
<p>
  ::: note
  If you're using Windows, consult <a href="##guide-windows">the guide to using Reach on Windows</a>.
  :::
</p>
<p>Once you've confirmed that they are installed, choose a directory for this project. We recommend</p>
<pre class="snippet numbered"><ol class="snippet"><li value="1">$ mkdir -p ~/reach/tut &amp;&amp; cd ~/reach/tut</li></ol></pre>
<p>Next, download Reach by running</p>
<pre class="snippet numbered"><ol class="snippet"><li value="1">$ curl https://docs.reach.sh/reach -o reach ; chmod +x reach</li></ol></pre>
<p>You'll know that the download worked if you can run</p>
<pre class="snippet numbered"><ol class="snippet"><li value="1">$ ./reach version</li></ol></pre>
<p>
  Since Reach is Dockerized, when you first use it, you'll need to download the images it uses.
  This will happen automatically when you first use it, but you can do it manually now by running
</p>
<pre class="snippet numbered"><ol class="snippet"><li value="1">$ ./reach update</li></ol></pre>
<p>You'll know that everything is in order if you can run</p>
<pre class="snippet numbered"><ol class="snippet"><li value="1">$ ./reach compile --help</li></ol></pre>

<p>Now that your Reach installation is in order, you should open a text editor and get ready to <a href="##tut-2">write your first Reach application</a>!</p>
<h2 id="scaffolding-and-setup">Scaffolding and Setup</h2>
<p>
  In this tutorial, we'll be building a version of <em>Rock, Paper, Scissors!</em> where two players, <em>Alice</em> and <em>Bob</em>, can wager on the result of the game.
  We'll start simple and slowly make the application more fully-featured.
</p>
<p>
  You should follow along by copying each part of the program and seeing how things go.
  If you're like us, you may find it beneficial to type each line out, rather than copying &amp; pasting so you can start building your muscle memory and begin to get a sense for each part of a Reach program.
</p>
<p>
  Let's start by creating a file named <code>index.rsh</code>.
  It doesn't matter where you put this file, but we recommend putting it in the current directory, which would be <code>~/reach/tut</code> if you're following along exactly.
  In all the subsequent code samples, we'll label the files based on the chapter of the tutorial you're reading.
  For example, start off by typing the following into <code>index.rsh</code>:
</p>
<p>${code("/examples/tut-2/index.rsh")}</p>
<p>
  ::: note
  Did you notice that <code>export</code>, <code>const</code>, <code>exit</code>, and so on are links?
  In Reach code samples, you can click on the names of keywords and standard library functions to be brought to their documentation.
  :::
</p>
<p>
  ::: note
  Did you notice that <a href="$%7Brepo%7D%7D/examples/tut-2/index.rsh">tut-2/index.rsh</a> was a link in the box above the code sample?
  You can always click on these links to see the entire file in our <a href="https://github.com/reach-sh/reach-lang">GitHub</a> repository.
  :::
</p>
<p>
  ::: note
  Did you notice the attractive clipboard icon on the top the right of that box?
  You can click on it and the content of the code box will be copied onto your clipboard.
  :::
</p>
<p>
  ::: note
  Did your text editor recognize <code>index.rsh</code> as a Reach program and give you proper syntax hightlighting?
  If not, check if there's a plugin available for your editor by visiting ${seclink("guide-editor-support")} or manually
  configure it to treat Reach (<code>.rsh</code>) files as JavaScript and things will be mostly correct.
  :::
</p>
<p>This is just a shell of a program that doesn't do much, but it has a few important components.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Line 1 indicates that this is a Reach program.
    You'll always have this at the top of every program.
  </li>
  <li>
    Line 3 defines the main export from the program.
    When you compile, this is what the compiler will look at.
  </li>
  <li>Lines 4 through 9 specify the two participants to this application, <em>Alice</em> and <em>Bob</em>.</li>
  <li>Line 10 marks the deployment of the the Reach program, which allows the program to start doing things.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Before we go too much further, let's create a similar shell for our JavaScript frontend code.
  Open a new file named <code>index.mjs</code> and fill it with this:
</p>
<p>${code("/examples/tut-2/index.mjs")}</p>
<p>
  ::: note
  Did you notice that <code>parseCurrency</code>, <code>newTestAccount</code>, <code>deploy</code>, and so on are links?
  In JavaScript code samples, you can click on the names of standard library functions to be brought to their documentation.
  :::
</p>
<p>This JavaScript code is similarly schematic and will be consistent across all of your test programs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Line 1 imports the Reach standard library loader.</li>
  <li>Line 2 imports your backend, which <code>./reach compile</code> will produce.</li>
  <li>Line 3 loads the standard library dynamically based on the <code>REACH_CONNECTOR_MODE</code> environment variable.</li>
  <li>Line 5 defines an asynchronous function that will be the body of our frontend.</li>
  <li>Line 6 defines a quantity of network tokens as the starting balance for each test account.</li>
  <li>
    Lines 7 and 8 create test accounts with initial endowments for Alice and Bob.
    This will only work on the Reach-provided developer testing network.
  </li>
  <li>
    Line 10 has Alice deploy the application.
    ::: note
    The program defined in <a href="$%7Brepo%7D%7D/examples/tut-2/index.rsh">tut-2/index.rsh</a> will only begin to run after it has been deployed via <a href="$%7Brepo%7D%7D/examples/tut-2/index.mjs">tut-2/index.mjs</a>.
    :::
  </li>
  <li>Line 11 has Bob attach to it.</li>
  <li>Lines 14 through 16 initialize a backend for Alice.</li>
  <li>Lines 17 through 19 initialize a backend for Bob.</li>
  <li>Line 13 waits for the backends to complete.</li>
  <li>Line 21 calls this asynchronous function that we've defined.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is now enough for Reach to compile and run our program. Let's try by running</p>
<pre class="snippet numbered"><ol class="snippet"><li value="1">$ ./reach run</li></ol></pre>
<p>
  Reach should now build and launch a Docker container for this application.
  Since the application doesn't do anything, you'll just see a lot of diagnostic messages though, so that's not very exciting.
</p>
<p>

  The entire process that we just went through can be automated by running ```

and that they will not accidentally be reintroduced.</li><li value="87"></li><li value="88">---</li><li value="89"></li><li value="90">Let's use these insights into [automatic verification](##guide-assert) and rewrite our _Rock, Paper, Scissors!_ so that it is more trustworthy and secure.</li><li value="91"></li><li value="92">Since we've been making lots of changes to the code, let's start fresh with a new version and we'll look at every single line again, to make sure that you aren't missing anything.</li><li value="93"></li><li value="94">First, we'll define the rules of _Rock, Paper, Scissors!_ a little bit more abstractly, so we can separate the logic of the game from the details of the application:</li><li value="95"></li><li value="96">${code("/examples/tut-5/index.rsh", 1, 7)}</li><li value="97"></li><li value="98">+ Line 1 is the usual Reach version header.</li><li value="99">+ Lines 3 and 4 define enumerations for the hands that may be played, as well as the outcomes of the game.</li><li value="100">+ Lines 6 and 7 define the function that computes the winner of the game.</li><li value="101"></li><li value="102"></li><li value="103">When we first wrote _Rock, Paper, Scissors!_, we asked you to trust that this formula for computing the winner is correct, but it is good to actually check.</li><li value="104">One way to check would be to implement a JavaScript frontend that didn't interact with a real user, nor would it randomly generate values, but instead, it would return specific testing scenario values and check that the output is as expected.</li><li value="105">That's a typical way to debug and is possible with Reach.</li><li value="106">However, Reach allows us to write such test cases directly into the Reach program as verification assertions.</li><li value="107"></li><li value="108">${code("/examples/tut-5/index.rsh", 9, 11)}</li><li value="109"></li><li value="110">+ Line 9 makes an assertion that when Alice plays Rock and Bob plays Paper, then Bob wins as expected.</li><li value="111"></li><li value="112"></li><li value="113">But, Reach's [automatic verification](##guide-assert) allows us to express even more powerful statements about our program's behavior.</li><li value="114">For example, we can state that no matter what values are provided for `handA` and `handB`, `winner` will always provide a valid outcome:</li><li value="115"></li><li value="116">${code("/examples/tut-5/index.rsh", 13, 15)}</li><li value="117"></li><li value="118">And we can specify that whenever the same value is provided for both hands, no matter what it is, `winner` always returns `DRAW`:</li><li value="119"></li><li value="120">${code("/examples/tut-5/index.rsh", 17, 18)}</li><li value="121"></li><li value="122">These examples both use `forall`, which allows Reach programmers to quantify over all possible values that might be provided to a part of their program.</li><li value="123">You might think that these theorems will take a very long time to prove, because they have to loop over all the billions and billions of possibilities (e.g., Ethereum uses 256-bits for its unsigned integers) for the bits of `handA` (twice!) and `handB`.</li><li value="124">In fact, on rudimentary laptops, it takes less than half a second.</li><li value="125">That's because Reach uses an advanced [symbolic execution engine](##guide-reach) to reason about this theorem abstractly without considering individual values.</li><li value="126"></li><li value="127">Let's continue the program by specifying the participant interact interfaces for Alice and Bob.</li><li value="128">These will be mostly the same as before, except that we will also expect that each frontend can provide access to random numbers.</li><li value="129">We'll use these later on to protect Alice's hand.</li><li value="130"></li><li value="131">${code("/examples/tut-5/index.rsh", 20, 24)}</li><li value="132"></li><li value="133">The only line that is different is line 21, which includes `hasRandom`, from the Reach standard library, in the interface.</li><li value="134"></li><li value="135">${code("/examples/tut-5/index.mjs", 20, 30)}</li><li value="136"></li><li value="137">Similarly, we only need to modify one line of our JavaScript frontend.</li><li value="138">Line 21 allows each participant's Reach code to generate random numbers as necessary.</li><li value="139"></li><li value="140">These two changes might look identical, but they mean very different things.</li><li value="141">The first, line 21 in the Reach program, adds `hasRandom` to the interface that the backend expects the frontend to provide.</li><li value="142">The second, line 21 in the JavaScript, adds `hasRandom` to the implementation that the frontend provides to the backend.</li><li value="143"></li><li value="144">We're now at the crucial juncture where we will implement the actual application and ensure that Alice's hand is protected until after Bob reveals his hand.</li><li value="145">The simplest thing would be to have Alice just publish the wager, but this, of course, would just leave Bob vulnerable.</li><li value="146">We need Alice to be able to publish her hand, but also keep it secret.</li><li value="147">This is a job for a [cryptographic commitment scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme).</li><li value="148">Reach's standard library comes with `makeCommitment` to make this easier for you.</li><li value="149"></li><li value="150">${code("/examples/tut-5/index.rsh", 37, 45)}</li><li value="151"></li><li value="152">+ Line 39 has Alice compute her hand, but _not_ declassify it.</li><li value="153">+ Line 40 has her compute a commitment to the hand.</li><li value="154">It comes with a secret "salt" value that must be revealed later.</li><li value="155">+ Line 41 has Alice declassify the commitment.</li><li value="156">+ Line 43 has her publish them, and line 44 has her include the wager funds in the publication.</li><li value="157"></li><li value="158"></li><li value="159">At this point, we can state the knowledge assertion that Bob can't know either the hand or the "salt" and continue with his part of the program.</li><li value="160"></li><li value="161">::: note</li><li value="162">It is important to include the salt in the commitment, so that multiple commitments to the same value are not identical.</li><li value="163">Similarly, it is important not to share the salt until later, because if an attacker knows the set of possible values, they can enumerate them and compare with the result of the commitment and learn the value.</li><li value="164">:::</li><li value="165"></li><li value="166">${code("/examples/tut-5/index.rsh", 47, 54)}</li><li value="167"></li><li value="168">+ Line 47 states the knowledge assertion.</li><li value="169">+ Lines 48 through 53 are unchanged from

value="172"></li><li value="173">We now return to Alice who can reveal her secrets.</li><li value="174"></li><li value="175">${code("/examples/tut-5/index.rsh", 56, 61)}</li><li value="176"></li><li

value="32">## Timeouts and Participation</li><li value="33"></li><li value="34">In the last section, we removed a security vulnerability from _Rock, Paper, Scissors!_ that was a clear attack on the viability of the application.</li><li value="35">In this section, we'll focus on a more subtle issue that is important and unique to decentralized applications: [non-participation](##guide-timeout).</li><li value="36"></li><li value="37">Non-participation refers to the act of one party ceasing to continue playing their role in an application.</li><li value="38"></li><li value="39">In traditional client-server programs, like a Web server, this would be the case of a client not sending any more requests to the server, or the server stopping sending responses to the client.</li><li value="40">In these sorts of traditional programs, non-participation is an exceptional circumstance that normally leads to an error message for clients and, at most, a log entry for servers.</li><li value="41">Sometimes traditional programs will need to recycle resources, like network ports, on non-participation, but they would have also needed to do that if the transaction ended by normal means.</li><li value="42">In other words, for traditional client-server programs, it is not necessary for designers to meticulously consider the consequences of non-participation.</li><li value="43"></li><li value="44">In contrast, decentralized applications must be carefully designed with an eye towards their behavior in the face of non-participation.</li><li value="45">For example, consider what happens in our _Rock, Paper, Scissors!_ game if after Alice has paid her wager, Bob never accepts and the application doesn't continue.</li><li value="46">In this case, Alice's network tokens would be locked inside of the contract and lost to her.</li><li value="47">Similarly, if after Bob accepted and paid his wager, Alice stopped participating and never submitted her hand, then both their funds would be locked away forever.</li><li value="48">In each of these cases, both parties would be greatly hurt and their fear of that outcome would introduce an additional cost to transacting, which would lower the value they got from participating in the application.</li><li value="49">Of course, in a situation like _Rock, Paper, Scissors!_ this is unlikely to be an important matter, but recall that _Rock, Paper, Scissors!_ is a microcosm of decentralized application design.</li><li value="50"></li><li value="51">::: note</li><li value="52">Technically, in the first case, when Bob fails to start the application, Alice is not locked away from her funds: since Bob's identity is not fixed until after his first message, she could start another instance of the game as the Bob role and then she'd win all of the funds, less any transaction costs of the consensus network.</li><li value="53">In the second case, however, there would be no recourse for either party.</li><li value="54">:::</li><li value="55"></li><li value="56">In the rest of this section, we'll discuss how Reach helps address non-participation.</li><li value="57">For a longer discussion, refer to [the guide chapter on non-participation](##guide-timeout).</li><li value="58"></li><li value="59">---</li><li value="60"></li><li value="61">In Reach, non-participation is handled through a "timeout" mechanism whereby each consensus transfer can be paired with a step that occurs for all participants if the originator of the consensus transfer fails to make the required publication before a particular network time.</li><li value="62">We'll integrate this mechanism into our version of _Rock, Paper, Scissors!_ and deliberately insert non-participation into our JavaScript testing program to watch the consequences play out.</li><li value="63"></li><li value="64">First, we'll modify the participant

  If you'd like to instead use Reach in your own JavaScript project,
  you can call:
</p>
<pre class="snippet numbered"><ol class="snippet"><li value="1">$ npm install @reach-sh/stdlib</li></ol></pre>
<p>
  ::: note
  The Reach standard library is undergoing continual improvement and is updated often.
  If you are experiencing issues with the Node.js package, try updating!
  :::
</p>
<p>As usual, you can compile your Reach program <code>index.rsh</code> to the <code>backend</code> build artifact <code>build/index.main.mjs</code> with:</p>
<pre class="snippet numbered"><ol class="snippet"><li value="1">$ ./reach compile</li></ol></pre>

<p>
  Now our implementation of <em>Rock, Paper, Scissors!</em> is live in the browser!
  We can leverage callbacks in the participant interact interface to display to and gather information from the user,
  through any Web UI framework of our choice.
</p>
<p>
  If we wanted to deploy this application to the world, then we would take the static files that React produces and host them on a Web server.
  These files embed your compiled Reach program, so there's nothing more to do than provide them to the world.
</p>
<p>In <a href="##tut-10">the next section</a>, we'll summarize where we've gone and direct you to the next step of your journey to decentralized application mastery.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="onward-and-further">Onward and Further</h2>
<p>Let's review what we've done through this tutorial:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In <a href="##tut-1">part one</a>, we saw how Reach can be installed with one command on almost any system without any dependencies beyond what most developers have anyways.</li>
  <li>In <a href="##tut-2">part two</a>, we saw how Reach programs have a succinct setup that easily abstracts the details of your chosen consensus network into a couple lines and three key API calls.</li>
  <li>In <a href="##tut-3">part three</a>, we saw how Reach allows developers to focus on the business logic of their decentralized application and look past the nitty-gritty details of blockchain interaction and protocol design.</li>
  <li>In <a href="##tut-4">part four</a>, we saw that it is just as easy for Reach to deal with tokens and network transactions as it is to deal with data sharing.</li>
  <li>In <a href="##tut-5">part five</a>, we introduced you to the Reach <a href="##guide-assert">automatic formal verification</a> engine and its ability to ensure our program doesn't have entire categories of flaws and security vulnerabilities.</li>
  <li>In <a href="##tut-6">part six</a>, we saw how Reach allows you to specify how to deal with <a href="##guide-timeout">non-participation</a> and protect against funds being locked in contracts.</li>
  <li>In <a href="##tut-7">part seven</a>, we saw how Reach can express arbitrary length interactions and how flexible the Reach frontends are to variations in the backend.</li>
  <li>In <a href="##tut-8">part eight</a>, we saw how to decouple your Reach program from the Reach standard testing environment and launch an interactive version on a real network.</li>
  <li>In <a href="##tut-9">part nine</a>, we saw how to deploy your Reach program as a fully decentralized Web application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite having done so much, this is really just a brief introduction to what is possible with Reach.</p>
<p>
  How difficult was all this?
  Let's look at the final versions of our programs.
</p>
<p>First, let's look at the Reach program:</p>
<p>${code("/examples/tut-8/index.rsh")}</p>
<p>Next, the JavaScript command-line frontend:</p>
<p>${code("/examples/tut-8/index.mjs")}</p>
<p>And finally, the Web frontend:</p>
<p>${code("/examples/tut-9/index.js")}</p>
<p>
  We wrote about a hundred lines of Reach and two different frontends.
  Our command-line version is about a hundred lines of JavaScript, while our Web version is about the same length, but has a lot of presentation code as well.
</p>
<p>
  Behind the scenes, Reach generated hundreds of lines of Solidity (which you can look at here: <a href="$%7Brepo%7D%7D/examples/tut-8/build/index.main.sol">tut-8/build/index.main.sol</a>), almost two thousand lines of TEAL (which you can look at here: <a href="$%7Brepo%7D%7D/examples/tut-8/build/index.main.appApproval.teal">tut-8/build/index.main.appApproval.teal</a>), as well as over a thousand lines of JavaScript (which you can look at here: <a href="$%7Brepo%7D%7D/examples/tut-8/build/index.main.mjs">tut-8/build/index.main.mjs</a>).
  If we weren't using Reach, then we'd have to write all this code ourselves and ensure that they are consistent and updated at every change to the application.
</p>
<p>Now that you've seen an entire Reach application from beginning to end, it's time for you to start working on your own applications!</p>
<ul>
  <li>You may want to start <a href="##workshop">the workshop</a>, which is a self-study course on practicing and learning Reach through different specific projects.</li>
  <li>Or, maybe you'd like to spend some time in <a href="##guide">the guide</a> learning about the background of some of the concepts used in Reach programs.</li>
  <li>Or, maybe it's time for you to dive into <a href="##ref">the reference</a> and look into the minutiae of Reach's features.</li>
