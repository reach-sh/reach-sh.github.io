  Reach makes library packaging very easy: simply push your code to
  <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> or
  <a href="https://bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a> and
  <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging">tag it</a> to mark a
  version number.

<p>
  Packages on GitHub may also activate the
  <a href="https://github.com/topics/reach-pkg">reach-pkg</a>
  topic by configuring it in their repo's
  <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/classifying-your-repository-with-topics">"About" configuration</a>
  to enjoy greater discoverability.

  The <a href="##ref-programs-import-package">package imports</a> reference section
  details Reach's remote module import syntax, and
  <a href="##ref-usage-compile">the compile command</a> reference describes the <code>--install-pkgs</code> command-line
  argument which allows remote packages to be fetched during compilation.
